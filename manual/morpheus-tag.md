### Morpheus-tag

```
<morpheus />
```

- ```ref=""``` sets the pointer of where the morpheus-tag should be applied. The *#id* will search for the ```<div id="id"></div>```. Without reference it will be applied on the spot (the position within the HTML document).

- ```content-type=""``` could be *HTML*, *XML*, *JSON*, *MD*. It is the type of the content of ```<morpheus>``` and ```</morpheus>```

- ```action=""``` could be *add* (*add-prefix*, *add-postfix*) or *replace*.

- ```template=""```
